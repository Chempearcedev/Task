## Test Plan 
---
#### Objectives:
A unit test for a function that that accepts an array of objects and prints out a two-dimensional array, whereby no two objects can be in the same set or have the same id and the outcome must consist of a combination of the objects from the array.

### Resources used
---
-	Gitpod/Github
-	 Dev tools – logging to the console

### Test steps
---
•	Are rows and columns functioning as stated in the function:  only 3 rows and 3 columns should be allowed when printing the 2 dimensional array 

•	Does the function accept the array as a parameter 

•	Are indexes of items within the array correctly targeted to allow the desired outcome 

•	Does the function loop over the items in the array from the correct starting point and stops at the desired point 

•	Does the array print in a 2 dimensional form
